How To Install Testfarm ?
---------------------------------------
(UNIX like Systems)

- execute the script "install.py" ensuring that you are the system root or a sudoer
	- example : If you have python2.4 and the lib is located in /usr/lib, ./install.py should create a directory in /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/testfarm and add testfarm source files to it. 


(Win32 like Systems)
- execute the script "install.py"
	- example : If you have python2.4 located in C:\Python24, 'C:\Python24\python.exe install.py' should create a directory in C:\Python24\lib\site-packages\testfarm and add testfarm source files to it. 

(General)
- Note: you can use an option, '--verbose',  with the install.py to see what the script is doing. Another option, '--help' will display a help about the use of the script.

How To Install a TestFarm Server ?
---------------------------------------

(UNIX like Systems)
- install libapache2-mod-python ( version >= 3.1 )

- $ cd /etc/apache2/conf.d 

- $ sudo ln -s /your/path/to/testfarm/mod_python_testfarm.conf

- edit mod_python_testfarm.conf 
  change the Alias /testfarm_server to point to  /your/path/to/testfarm/src/server_side.py
  change DirectoryMatch to point to /your/path/to/testfarm/src/

- check that the testfarm/src/server_side.py file and its parent directories are
  accessible by a different user. Tip check this: 
    $ sudo su nobody
    $ ls -l /you/path/to/testfarm/server_side_logger.py

- $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
