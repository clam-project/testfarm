<h1>TestFarm</h1>
<h3>the continuous testing and monitoring tool</h3>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
TestFarm is a client-server <tt>Python</tt> app that allows monitoring the stability and efficiency of a devel project by performing continuous builds and tests in multiple platforms. The overall idea is based on Mozilla Tinderbox. 
With a really simple approach and sound extensibility mechanisms.
</p>

<p>Compared to other alternatives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TestFarm <tt>doesn't depend on anything</tt> other that python 2.4 and apache mod_python (which is optional).
      No bonsai or other CVS tools, and no databases (maiybe this will change)</li>
  
  <li>A TestFarm client is also <tt>useful without a server</tt>, since it
      can generate html pages locally.</li>
  
  <li>A TestFarm <tt>server needs no configuration</tt> and is independent of the clients. 
      When a new client is executed a new column is automatically be added in the project page. 
      And the same applies for the whole project.</li>
  
  <li><tt>Simple client scripts</tt> (See an example: <a href="../clam_build.py">clam_build.py</a>.) 
      which are extensible with pluggable python functions. 
      These python functions allows publishing informational data, 
      change the status of a command, add statistics...
      That allows testfarm to integrat very easily with anything: from testing framework (ala xUnit)
      to concurrent management system</li>
  
  <li><tt>It is multiplatform</tt>, of course!  It works (at least) on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX</li>
</ul>

<p>TestFarm is being developed mainly by Pau Arumí (parumi at iua dot upf dot edu).
And it started as a need for the <a href="http://clam.iua.upf.edu">CLAM</a> (C++ Library for Audio and Music) project.
Other contributors are Bram de Jong and Mohamed Sordo.
