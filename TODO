Done 	- summary text format based on: key, [ok|no] so that the server can easily parse it
Done 	- efficiency, etc. statistics. based on TAG, number also in the summary? statistics section
Done 	- client writes colorized output in console and sends step-by-step progress to server
Done	- Idle State
Done	- Propagate "idle" checking to HTML (logs)
Done	- xml/easier text format YAML --> Plain Python Code!!
Done	- essentia in linux
Done	- Remove "log" sufix in idle methods
Done	- Examples use appropiate logs dir

Low Priority
	- define cvs repository and branch (and backend cvs, svn) so the server can hunt guilty commits.
	- separate config script and command line tool with options: verbose, disable repository, server url
	- send mail option?? mmmm... it is up to the StabilityLevelChecker which should be in the server.
	  -> alarms instead of stability levels
	- Idle with threading repositories (very low priority)

Medium Priority
	- communication via http post
	- Mileston 2: remote server
	- set up a "universal" server for any project (be aware of security issues, spam...)
	- Stop client "gently"
	  -> Propagate "user aborted" to HTML
	- Mandatory / Breaking tasks
	- Tasks in HTML with proportional size
	- Rotate logs
	- Send begin command 
	- CLAM in windows
	- essentia in windows
	- ardour2 in linux
	- first iteration new_commits should return always true 

High Priority
	- Adapt to Windows 
	- Adapt to MacOS X
	- Checking <-> Check. Ask Bram
	- BUG : Fix idle messages in console - MS
	- BUG TestFarmClient without name - MS
	  -> assert that name is a string
	- BUG after command completion should update html - MS
	- Multiple repositories 
	- Expandible info (and stats) with javascript - MS
	- CLAM in linux - PA
	- publish CLAM htmls, via script that makes scp each X minutes - PA
	- CLAM in mac osx





bram's idea:

<a href="javascript: document.getElementById('id_15').style.display='block'; document.getElementById('id_15_short').style.display='none';">toggle information display</a>

<p id="id_15_short" class="info-short">bleep</p>

<p id="id_15" class="info" style:"display:none">bleep</p>
