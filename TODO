- define cvs repository and branch (and backend cvs, svn) so the server can hunt guilty commits.
- config and command line options: verbose, disable project, local file, server url
Done - efficiency, etc. statistics. based on TAG, number also in the summary? statistics section
- xml/easier text format YAML
Done - client writes colorized output in console and sends step-by-step progress to server
